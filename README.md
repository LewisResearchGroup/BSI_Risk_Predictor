# BSI Risk Predictor
This tool provides a model-based estimate of 30-day mortality probability. It uses four inputs: Age, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), Pitt Bacteremia Score (PBS), and SOFA score to generate a probability derived from a machine learning model trained on historical data. This estimate should be interpreted as a statistical output, not a clinical determination.
